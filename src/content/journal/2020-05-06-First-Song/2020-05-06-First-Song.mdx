Finally finished my first song in Ableton. The interface has always been a steep learning curve for me but everything finally clicked. Not gonna lie, I cheated a little and downloaded an app to tell me what the harmonic chords were and I just kept jamming on it until this came out. I drew lots of inspiration from deadmau5, my favorite producer of all time. Also a little throw back trance vibe from the 90s.

Hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it!
